      <h2>About.</h2>

      <p>HST stands for "Http single threaded". This is a lightweight C library for writing
      HTTP application servers running in constrained environments such as embedded
      systems or low-end virtual private servers (VPS).</p>

      <p>Servers written with HST are intended to be used with trusted clients or they
      must be put behind reverse-proxy such as
      <a href="http://nginx.org" target="_blank">Nginx</a> since they are vulnerable
      to denial of service (DOS) attack known as slow requests.</p>

<pre>
todo:
-----

idea how to overcome slow requests attack:
1. when connection is made store timestamp.
2. when recv() returns check passed time. if it is larger then some thershold
   then abort.

better idea: use nonblocking socket io with timeouts
