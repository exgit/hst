      <h2>About.</h2>
      <p>HST stands for "Http single threaded". This is a simple C library for writing
      HTTP application servers running in constrained environments such as embedded
      systems or low-end virtual private servers (VPS). Typically it's intended to
      be used in relatively small C program working behind reverse-proxy such as
      <a href="http://nginx.org" target="_blank">Nginx</a>.</p>
